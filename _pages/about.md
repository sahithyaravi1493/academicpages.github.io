Hi! I am an AI researcher and software engineer at the Machine Learning Lab of TU/e. 
I am proud to be supervised by amazing researchers [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/#lab) and [Mykola Pechenizkiy] (https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/).  My goal is to democratize machine learning by making it more accessible, automated, reproducible and interpretable. 
Before joining the ML lab, I was a Masters student at TU/e, where I worked on a wide range of problems from IoT to bit coin mining and machine learning.
